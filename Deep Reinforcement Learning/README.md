## ü§ñ Deep Reinforcement Learning Collection

This collection of project samples showcase my skills in reinforcement learning and deep learning. It features practical implementations, experiments with custom toy environments, and evaluations of various reinforcement learning techniques, including:

- **Optimization Techniques**: Implementations of CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy) and GCBC (Gradient-Based Continuous Control).
- **Reinforcement Learning Methods**: Examples of episodic reinforcement learning and comparisons of exploration algorithms in the 10-armed bandit problem.
- **Custom Test Environments**: Creation of toy environments for sanity checks, experimentation, evaluation, and enhancement of reinforcement learning algorithms.

### Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Colab**
- **PyTorch**
- **Tensorflow**
- **Gym**
- **NumPy**
- **Visualization Libraries**: (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)
- **Functools**

### üß∏
Training a reinforcement learning model is fun! It‚Äôs a lot like training a pet‚Äîgive the right incentives, the learning process quickly adapts and learns to solve the problem more effectively, just like how a smart kitty/puppy quickly masters new tricks üêæüéì

**Note:** 
The experiments and code in this repository are inspired by and adapted from Sutton & Barto's *Reinforcement Learning* book and academic labs from Deep Reinforcement Learning course at CMU.
