## ðŸ¤– Deep Reinforcement Learning Collection

This collection of project samples showcase my skills in reinforcement learning and deep learning. It features practical implementations, experiments with custom toy environments, and evaluations of various reinforcement learning techniques, including:

- **Optimization Techniques**: Implementations of CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy) and GCBC (Gradient-Based Continuous Control).
- **Reinforcement Learning Methods**: Examples of episodic reinforcement learning and comparisons of exploration algorithms in the 10-armed bandit problem.
- **Toy Environments**: Creation of custom toy environments for sanity checks, experimentation, evaluation, and enhancement of reinforcement learning algorithms.

### Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Colab**
- **PyTorch**:
- **Tensorflow**
- **Gym**
- **NumPy**
- **Visualization Libraries**: (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)
- **Functools**

**Note:** 
The experiments and code in this repository are inspired by and adapted from Sutton & Barto's *Reinforcement Learning* book and academic labs at CMU.
