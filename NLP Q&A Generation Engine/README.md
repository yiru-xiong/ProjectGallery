## üìÅ Project Overview

This repository features code snippets and highlights related to **NLP Question Generation** and **Answering**. These snippets illustrate essential components and techniques for developing systems that generate and respond to binary questions using natural language processing (NLP).

**Collaborative Project Contributions:**

- **Matching Algorithm**: Developed an algorithm to identify the closest matched content from a knowledge base for accurate answer generation.
- **Utilities and Features**: Implemented essential utilities and features within the generator's infrastructure.
- **Customized Grammar Checker**: Created a grammar checker to evaluate the quality of matched results and detect grammatical errors.
- 
**Flowchart:** A flowchart detailing the matching algorithm's process is included to help visualize the algorithm's operation and decision-making steps.

**Note:** The code provided represents partial implementations designed to demonstrate specific functionalities.
