# ðŸ’» Computer Systems Fundamentals - C Programming Samples

This collection of programming samples written in C showcases my understanding of computer systems fundamentals and demonstrates my skills in system-level programming.

### **Tiny Shell Implementation**
- **Description:**
  A custom tiny shell implementation (`tsh`) featuring:
  - Job management with Process ID (PID) and Job ID (JID).
  - Supports background and foreground job execution.
  - Built-in commands including `quit`, `jobs`, `bg`, and `fg`.
  - Handles signal interruptions and reaps zombie processes.
  - Supports I/O redirection and built-in commands for job control including `quit`, `jobs`, `bg`, and `fg`

### **Cache Simulator**
- **Description:**
  A simplified cache simulator designed to emulate cache memory behavior:
  - Simulates cache memory with arbitrary size and associativity.
  - Implements LRU (Least Recently Used) replacement policy.
  - Adheres to write-back and write-allocate policies.
  - Outputs metrics including hits, misses, evictions, and dirty bytes.
