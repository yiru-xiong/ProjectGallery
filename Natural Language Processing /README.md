## NLP Exploration Gallery

This collections feature some of my hands-on exploration and implementations in the field of NLP.

### **Project Highlights:**

- **Q&A Generation Engine**: An intelligent Q&A engine that demonstrates semantic matching, ranking, and grammar checking. This project was developed to enhance conversational AI capabilities and demonstrate practical applications of NLP techniques.

- **Sentiment Classification**: Code snippets Include various implementations for sentiment classifier, utilizing models such as Naive Bayes, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). 

- **Algorithm Implementations**: Features the Viterbi Algorithm and Hidden Markov Models (HMM), illustrating their use in sequence prediction and probabilistic modeling within NLP tasks such as Part-of-Speech (POS) and Tagging.

### **Tech Stack:**

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks, Docker
