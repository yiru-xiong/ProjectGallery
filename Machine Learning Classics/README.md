# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

This collection of machine learning and deep learning project samples showcase a range of classic and advanced techniques. They help to deepen my understanding of key concepts in the machine learning field.

## Project Overview

1. **Mini-PyTorch Implementation**  
   Implemented a simplified version of PyTorch from scratcha simplified version of PyTorch from scratch, which provided a deep understanding of fundamental concepts such as gradient descent, forward and backward propagation, and loss function computation.
2. **Naive Bayes Sentiment Classifier**  
   Implemented a sentiment analysis classifier using the Naive Bayes algorithm. This classic method effectively handles text classification tasks and offers insights into probabilistic models and feature independence. It is a good choice of baseline model in many modeling scenarios.
3. **Random Forest Sentiment Classifier**  
   Implemented a sentiment analysis model using the Random Forest algorithm, an ensemble method that improves classification accuracy and robustness. The project also involved exploring various hyperparameter tuning techniques.
4. **Deep Learning-Based Video Forgery Detector**  
   Implemented a deep learning model for detecting video forgeries, such as DeepFakes, by adapting the MesoNet-4 architecture from the this [paper](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F1809.00888.pdf) by Afchar et al.

## ðŸ§¸

Building the mini-PyTorch framework from scratch was particularly enlightening. It provided me with an in-depth understanding of essential concepts which are often abstracted away in high-level frameworks. This project has strengthened my appreciation for the complexities of deep learning models and has demystified these "black box" magics to some extent. The more I learn, the more I realize how much there is still to discover.
